The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is Gross Profit in the year ending 2024?,"Step 1: Identify the Formula
The formula for Gross Profit is: Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

Step 2: Locate the Required Data
I know both Revenue and COGS are in the Income Statement. From the Income Statement, Revenue is $254,453 and COGS is $222,358

Step 3: Apply the Formula

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is unadjusted EBITDA for the year ending in 2024?,"Step 1: Identify the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization

Step 2: Determine Unadjusted EBIT
Unadjusted EBIT equals Operating Income. I check the Income Statement, to find the Income Statement of $9,285

Step 3: Find Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and Amortization is found on the Cash Flow Statement. Checking the Cash Flow Statement, I see a Depreciation and amortization line item of $2,237

Step 4: Apply the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237
Unadjusted EBITDA = $11,522 (in millions)","$11,522 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is adjusted EBITDA for the year ending in 2024?,"To calculate adjusted EBITDA, we should first start with unadjusted EBITDA and make adjustments that make sense, like one-time expenses or operating / variable lease costs since we are classifying them as debt equivalents.

First, let's find unadjusted EBITDA. Step 1: Identify the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization

Step 2: Determine Unadjusted EBIT
Unadjusted EBIT equals Operating Income. I check the Income Statement, to find the Income Statement of $9,285

Step 3: Find Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and Amortization is found on the Cash Flow Statement. Checking the Cash Flow Statement, I see a Depreciation and amortization line item of $2,237

Step 4: Apply the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237
Unadjusted EBITDA = $11,522

The second part is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to add back operating and variable lease costs in EBITDA. This is because operating and variable leases expenses, which are embedded in merchandise costs or SG&A are composed of interest and depreciation / amortization of their respective asset. Since this is EBITDA, or before interest and depreciation, we can add the whole cost back. We do not need to add-back the amortization and interest of finance leases because the amortization is baked into the D&A expense (2,237), which was already added back. On the other hand, finance lease interest expense is stated to be included in interest expense and merchandise cost; since the allocation is not specificed, we assume that has already been factored into the interest expense line-item and does not need to be added back. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBITDA + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 11,522 + 284 + 163 = $11,969 (in millions)","$11,969 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is unadjusted EBIT for the year ending in 2024?,"Step 1: Identify the Formula

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is adjusted EBIT for the year ending in 2024?,"To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should first start with unadjusted EBIT and then make adjustments that make sense. 

The first step is to get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we know that EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

The second step is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to look for other interest expenses or tax expenses that need to be added back if they were included in EBIT.  One common embedded interest expense is operating lease expense from the newer accounting rules. Looking at Note 5 - Leases, we also see variable leases, so we need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). 

To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, We don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, we do see a variable lease cost line item, so we will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). However, this is still an assumption being made. Consequently, we take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBIT + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = $9396.1963 (in millions)","$9,396 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Compute the unadjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024. ,"To calculate unadjusted EBITDA margin, we need to think about the parts of EBITDA margin, which are the unadjusted EBITDA Margin and the revenue for 2024. We can then find the margin by taking unadjusted EBITDA margin and dividing it by revenue.

Step 1: Find Revenue
We find revenue on the Income Statement to be 254453.

Step 2: Calculate unadj. EBITDA
To calculate unadjusted EBITDA, we think about how to get to EBITDA, unadj. EBITDA = unadj. EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization.

To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we know that EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

On the Cash Flow statement, we find Depreciation + Amortization to be 2,237.

Hence,  EBITDA = 9,285 + 2,237 = 11522

Finally, unadj. EBITDA Margin = unadj. EBITDA / Revenue = 11522 / 254453 = 4.53% ",4.53%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Compute the adjusted EBITDA Margin for 2024. ,"To find adjusted EBITDA margin, we need to find adjusted EBITDA and also find the revenue for 2024. Adjusted EBITDA margin = Adjusted EBITDA / Revenue.

First, finding adjusted EBITDA: To calculate adjusted EBITDA, we should first start with unadjusted EBITDA and make adjustments that make sense, like one-time expenses or operating / variable lease costs since we are classifying them as debt equivalents.

First, let's find unadjusted EBITDA. Step 1: Identify the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization

Step 2: Determine Unadjusted EBIT
Unadjusted EBIT equals Operating Income. I check the Income Statement, to find the Income Statement of $9,285

Step 3: Find Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and Amortization is found on the Cash Flow Statement. Checking the Cash Flow Statement, I see a Depreciation and amortization line item of $2,237

Step 4: Apply the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237
Unadjusted EBITDA = $11,522

The second part is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to add back operating and variable lease costs in EBITDA. This is because operating and variable leases expenses, which are embedded in merchandise costs or SG&A are composed of interest and depreciation / amortization of their respective asset. Since this is EBITDA, or before interest and depreciation, we can add the whole cost back. We do not need to add-back the amortization and interest of finance leases because the amortization is baked into the D&A expense (2,237), which was already added back. On the other hand, finance lease interest expense is stated to be included in interest expense and merchandise cost; since the allocation is not specificed, we assume that has already been factored into the interest expense line-item and does not need to be added back. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBITDA + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 11,522 + 284 + 163 = $11,969 (in millions)

After finding adjusted EBITDA, the second step is finding revenue for 2024, which we can find on the income statement: 254,453

To calculate EBITDA margin, we take adjusted EBITDA / revenue = 11,969 / 254,453 = 4.7% ",4.70%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the Operating Profit Margin in the year ending 2024?,"Step 1: Identify the Formula

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Is Operating Profit Margin greater in 2024 compared to 2023?,"Step 1: Identify the Formula

Operating Margin = Operating Profit / Revenue

Step 2: Find line items and calculate margins

Operating Profit and Revenue are found on the Income Statement, checking there I see:
- Revenue 2024: $254,453
- Revenue 2023: $242,290
- Operating Profit 2024: $9,285
- Operating Profit 2023: $8,114

Hence, 
2024 Operating Margin = $9,285 / $254,453 = 0.0365 or 3.65%
2023 Operating Margin = $8,114 / $242,290 = 0.0335 or 3.35%

Step 3: Compare Margins
2024 Operating Margin of 3.65% is greater than 2023 Operating Margin: 3.35%

So, yes, Operating Profit Margin is greater in 2024 compared to 2023.",Yes,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023
Gross unrecognized tax benefit at beginning of year $ 16 $ 16
Gross increases—current year tax positions 3 1
Gross increases—tax positions in prior years 64 11
Gross decreases—tax positions in prior years —

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate Operating Profit for 2024.,"Step 1: Identify the Formula

Operating Profit = Revenue - COGS - OpEx

Step 2: Find Line Items
These line items are found in the Income Statement. Checking the Income Statement, I see an Operating income line item of $9,285, which is the same as Operating Profit.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the P/E ratio for 2024 using Basic EPS?,"Step 1: Identify the Formula

P/E Ratio = Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS) or Net Income / Shares Outstanding

Given specification wasn't provided, I will assume we want basic EPS (which uses Basic Shares Outstanding) and not diluted EPS (uses Diluted Shares Outstanding).

Step 2: Find Price per Share and EPS
I think it would be easier for me to calculate P/E with Price per Share and EPS, if they are provided.

Price per Share is given to be $940.00. EPS, if provided, will be on the Income Statement, checking there, I see a basic EPS to be $16.59. 

Step 3: Apply the Formula

P/E Ratio = $940.00 / $16.59
P/E Ratio = 56.66x",56.66x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the P/E ratio for 2024 using Diluted EPS?,"Step 1: Identify the Formula

P/E Ratio using Diluted EPS = Price per Share / Diluted EPS or Net Income / Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO)


Step 2: Find Price per Share and EPS
I think it would be easier for me to calculate P/E with Price per Share and EPS, if they are provided.

Price per Share is given to be $940.00. EPS, if provided, will be on the Income Statement, checking there, I see a diluted EPS to be $16.56. However, I don't know if Costco correctly calculated FDSO, so I will hand calculate it.

Step 3: Calculate FDSO
Step 3a: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 3b: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 3c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 3d: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000

Step 4: Calculate Diluted EPS
Diluted EPS = Net Income / FDSO. From the Income Statement, I see 2024 Net Income was $7,367. Hence, Diluted EPS = 7,367 / 445,592,000 * 1,000,000. I multiply by one million since the numerator is in millions.

Step 3: Apply the Formula

P/E Ratio = $940.00 / (7,367 / 445,592,000 * 1,000,000)
P/E Ratio = 56.86x",56.86x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the Diluted EPS of Costco? Manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.,"Step 1: Identify the Formula

Diluted EPS = Net Income / Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO)

Step 2: Calculate FDSO
Step 2a: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 2b: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 2c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 2d: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000

Step 4: Find Net Income
From the Income Statement, I see 2024 Net Income was $7,367

Step 3: Apply the Formula

Diluted EPS = 7,367 / 445,592,000 * 1,000,000 = $16.53. I multiply by one million since the numerator is in millions.",$16.53,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Determine the EV/EBITDA ratio for 2024. Make sure to adjust for EBITDA and use the market value of equity to estimate enterprise value. Make sure to hand calculated fully diluted shares outstanding. Assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash.,"To calculate EV / EBITDA, I need to calculate EV and calculate EBITDA (adjusted).

Calculating EV:
To calculate enterprise value, we can use the formula for EV = Equity Value + Debt / Debt Equivalents + Preferred Equity + MInority Interest - Excess Cash. We would also subtract any other non-operating assets, and the question lets us assume that the only non-operating asset that needs to be subtracted is excess cash. First, we need to find each of the parts of the formula.

Part 1. Equity Value
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 1. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 1a: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 1b: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 1c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 1d: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2. Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Part 2. Debt / Debt Equivalents
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 
Step 2: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 
Step 3: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,465.85 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 3. Next, looking for mentions of preferred equity. Spotted preferred stock in the income statement, but there are no shares issued.

Step 4. Next, looking for mentions of minority interest or noncontrolling interest. There is a line item in the income statement, stating net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, but in 2024, that number is zero, so we can assume that there is no minority interest. There is no mention of noncontrolling interest or minority interest on the balance sheet.

Part 5. Excess cash and other non-operating assets
Excess cash can be calculated by taking cash and cash equivalents and subtracting operating cash.
Step 1. Calculating operating cash. 
Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. First, assume operating cash to be 2% of 2024 Revenue, or 254,453 * 0.02 = 5089.06. 
Next, To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.
Step 2. Calculating Excess Cash
As given before, cash and cash equivalents is 11144, so excess cash is 11144 - 5089 = $6054.94 (in millions)

Putting it all together, EV = (445,592,000 * 940)/100000 + 11,414.85 - 6054.94 = $424,216 (in millions) 

Calculating Adjusted EBITDA:
To calculate adjusted EBITDA, we should first start with unadjusted EBITDA and make adjustments that make sense, like one-time expenses or operating / variable lease costs since we are classifying them as debt equivalents.

First, let's find unadjusted EBITDA. Step 1: Identify the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization

Step 2: Determine Unadjusted EBIT
Unadjusted EBIT equals Operating Income. I check the Income Statement, to find the Income Statement of $9,285

Step 3: Find Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and Amortization is found on the Cash Flow Statement. Checking the Cash Flow Statement, I see a Depreciation and amortization line item of $2,237

Step 4: Apply the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237
Unadjusted EBITDA = $11,522

The second part is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to add back operating and variable lease costs in EBITDA. This is because operating and variable leases expenses, which are embedded in merchandise costs or SG&A are composed of interest and depreciation / amortization of their respective asset. Since this is EBITDA, or before interest and depreciation, we can add the whole cost back. We do not need to add-back the amortization and interest of finance leases because the amortization is baked into the D&A expense (2,237), which was already added back. On the other hand, finance lease interest expense is stated to be included in interest expense and merchandise cost; since the allocation is not specificed, we assume that has already been factored into the interest expense line-item and does not need to be added back. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBITDA + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 11,522 + 284 + 163 = $11,969 (in millions)

EV / EBITDA = ((445,592,000 * 940)/100000 + 11,414.85 - 6054.94) / 11,969 = 35.44x

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate Enterprise Value for 2024 with the market value of equity. Make sure to hand calculated fully diluted shares outstanding. Assume the only non-operating asset is excess cash.,"To calculate enterprise value, we can use the formula for EV = Equity Value + Debt / Debt Equivalents + Preferred Equity + MInority Interest - Excess Cash. We would also subtract any other non-operating assets, and the question lets us assume that the only non-operating asset that needs to be subtracted is excess cash. First, we need to find each of the parts of the formula.

Part 1. Equity Value
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 1. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 1a: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 1b: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 1c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 1d: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2. Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Part 2. Debt / Debt Equivalents
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 
Step 2: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 
Step 3: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,465.85 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 3. Next, looking for mentions of preferred equity. Spotted preferred stock in the income statement, but there are no shares issued.

Step 4. Next, looking for mentions of minority interest or noncontrolling interest. There is a line item in the income statement, stating net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, but in 2024, that number is zero, so we can assume that there is no minority interest. There is no mention of noncontrolling interest or minority interest on the balance sheet.

Part 5. Excess cash and other non-operating assets
Excess cash can be calculated by taking cash and cash equivalents and subtracting operating cash.
Step 1. Calculating operating cash. 
Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. First, assume operating cash to be 2% of 2024 Revenue, or 254,453 * 0.02 = 5089.06. 
Next, To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.
Step 2. Calculating Excess Cash
As given before, cash and cash equivalents is 11144, so excess cash is 11144 - 5089 = $6054.94 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the Equity Value in 2024? Assume Enterprise Value is 420 Billion and assume the only non-operating asset not factored into Enterprise Value is excess cash.,"To calculate equity value from enterprise value (EV), we can use the formula EV - Debt / Debt Equivalents - Pref Equity - Minority Interest + Cash + other non-operating assets not factored into EV. We would also add back any non-operating assets that weren't calculated in EV, but the question lets us assume that the only non-operating asset that needs to be added back is excess cash. First, we need to find each of the parts of the formula.

Step 1. We have been given an enterprise value of $420 Billion.

Step 2. The next step is to calculate debt and debt equivalents: To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,465.85 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 3. Next, looking for mentions of pref. equity. Spotted preferred stock in the income statement, but there are no shares issued.

Step 4. Next, looking for mentions of minority interest or noncontrolling interest. There is a line item in the income statement, stating net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, but in 2024, that number is zero, so we can assume that there is no minority interest. There is no mention of noncontrolling interest or minority interest on the balance sheet.

Step 5. Finally, looking for cash. Note that the question stated the enterprise value calculated already factored in changes in operating cash, meaning that that the cash we need to add back is only Excess cash. Calculating excess cash: Excess cash is cash and cash equivalents subtracting operating cash.

Excess cash can be calculated by taking cash and cash equivalents and subtracting operating cash.
Part 1. Calculating operating cash. 
Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. First, assume operating cash to be 2% of 2024 Revenue, or 254,453 * 0.02 = 5089.06. 
Next, To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.
Part 2. Calculating excess cash
As given before, cash and cash equivalents is 11144, so excess cash is 11144 - 5089 = $6054.94 (in millions)

To put it all together, to calculate equity value: EV + Debt - Excess Cash = 420000 + 11414.85 - 6054.94 = $414640 (in millions)

remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Compute the Market Value of Equity for 2024. Manually calculate fully diluted shares outstanding.,"To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 1. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 1a: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 1b: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 1c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 1d: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2. Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million","$418,856 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Estimate the Cost of Equity using the CAPM model for 2024.,"To calculate Cost of Equity, I will apply the CAPM formula: Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate of Return + Beta * (Market Rate of Return - Risk-Free Rate of Return)

Step 1: Collect Rates and Beta
The 10Y Treasury is provided (4.617%) and is a good proxy for the risk free rate. Beta is provided to be 0.79 and the market risk premium is provided at 11%. 

Step 2: Apply Formula
Cost of Equity = 4.617% + 0.79 * (11% - 4.617%)  = 9.66%",9.66%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate WACC for 2024.,"To calculate WACC, we apply the formula: WACC = Cost of Equity * (% Equity) + Cost of Debt * (% Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate).

Step 1: Calculate Total Debt
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1a: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 
Step 1b: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 
Step 1c: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052. + 1,466 = $11,414.85 (in millions).
Step 2: Calculate Total Equity
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 2a. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 2a.1: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 2a.2: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 2a.3: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 2a.4: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2b: Find Price per Share and Apply Formula
Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Step 3: Calculate cost of debt
Cost of debt is given at 6%

Step 4: Calculate cost of equity
To calculate Cost of Equity, I will apply the CAPM formula: Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate of Return + Beta * (Market Rate of Return - Risk-Free Rate of Return)
Step 4a: Collect Rates and Beta
The 10Y Treasury is provided (4.617%) and is a good proxy for the risk free rate. Beta is provided to be 0.79 and the market risk premium is provided at 11%. 
Step 4b: Apply Formula
Cost of Equity = 4.617% + 0.79 * (11% - 4.617%)  = 9.66%

Step 5: Apply formula:
Hence WACC = 9.66%*(418,856/(11,414.85+418,856)) + 6%*(11,414.85/(11,414.85+418,856)) = 9.66%",9.56%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is market debt to equity ratio?,"To calculate Market Debt to Equity, we apply the formula: Market D/E or Debt to Equity = Market Value of Debt / Market Value of Equity.

Step 1: Calculate Total Debt
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1a: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 

Step 1b: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 

Step 1c: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052. + 1,466 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 2: Calculate Total Equity 
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 2a. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 2a.1: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 2a.2: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 2a.c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 2a.4: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2b. Find the Price per Share and Apply Formula
Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Step 3: Apply formula for Debt / Equity
Market debt to equity = 11,414.85 / 418,856 = 2.73%",2.73%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the Debt to Value in 2024?,"To calculate the market Debt to Value (D/V), we apply the formula: D/V = Debt / (Debt + Market Value of Equity + Pref Equity).

From the Balance Sheet, I notice there is no preferred equity, so the denominator becomes Debt + Equity.

Step 1: Calculate Total Debt
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1a: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 

Step 1b: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 

Step 1c: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,466 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 2: Calculate Total Equity 
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 2a. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 2a.1: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 2a.2: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 2a.c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 2a.4: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2b. Find the Price per Share and Apply Formula
Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Step 3: Apply formula
Debt to Value = 11,414.85 / (11,414.85+418,856) = 2.65%",2.65%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

_______________
(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the Equity to Value in 2024?,"To calculate the market Equity to Value (E/V), we apply the formula: E/V = Equity / (Debt + Market Value of Equity + Pref Equity).

From the Balance Sheet, I notice there is no preferred equity, so the denominator becomes Debt + Equity.

Step 1: Calculate Total Debt
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1a: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 

Step 1b: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 

Step 1c: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,466 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 2: Calculate Total Equity 
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 2a. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 2a.1: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 2a.2: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 2a.c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 2a.4: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2b. Find the Price per Share and Apply Formula
Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Step 3: Apply formula
Equity to Value = 418,856 / (11,414.85+418,856) = 97.35%",97.35%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the effective tax rate in 2024?,"The Effective Tax Rate is often given in the Tax note of a 10K.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the marginal tax rate in 2024?,"The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%",24.00%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What are the statutory / marginal taxes on adjusted EBIT?,"To calculate the statutory taxes, we multiply the marginal tax rate by adjusted EBIT: 
Step 1: Calculating marginal tax rate: 
The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%

Step 2: Calculating adjusted EBIT: 
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should start with unadjusted EBIT. To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 

Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 3: Multiplying the two
24% * 9396.196 = $2255.087 (in millions)","$2,255 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the operating tax in 2024?,"To calculate operating taxes, we need to find the statutory taxes on EBIT and then add / subtract additional operating taxes. 

The first step to do is calculate the statutory taxes on EBIT: 
To calculate the statutory taxes, we multiply the marginal tax rate by adjusted EBIT. 
Step 1: Calculating marginal tax rate: 
The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%

Step 2: Calculating adjusted EBIT: 
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should start with unadjusted EBIT. To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 

Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 3: Multiplying the two
24% * 9396.196 = $2255.087 (in millions)

The next step is to add / subtract operating taxes:  Looking at the tax reconciliation table, we can see that there are federal taxes, state taxes, foreign taxes, ESOP taxes, and other taxes. Thinking through each tax and whether or not it impacts the operating business. Federal and state impact the domestic operating business, foreign taxes impact the foreign operating business, and an employee stock ownership plan also impacts the operations of the business (paying off employees). Other is not detailed, so we will assume it is not related to the operating business as it could be any changes. We already factored in the statutory taxes (federal and state) to see their impact on the operating business, so what is remaining are the foreign operating business taxes and ESOP taxes which are 109 and -120, respectively. 

Since the table provides the numerical quantities of taxes (in addition to the percentages), we can add them up with the number we got earlier (for statutory taxes on EBIT) to get operating taxes: 2255.087 + 109 - 120 = $2244.087 (in millions)","$2,244 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the operating cash tax in 2024?,"To calculate operating cash taxes, we need to consider non-cash tax payments that might be included in the operating cash tax, so taking operating cash tax and adding deferred tax expense.

Part 1. Calculate operating taxes: 
To calculate operating taxes, we need to find the statutory taxes on EBIT and then add / subtract additional operating taxes. 

The first step to do is calculate the statutory taxes on EBIT: 
To calculate the statutory taxes, we multiply the marginal tax rate by adjusted EBIT. 
Step 1: Calculating marginal tax rate: 
The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%

Step 2: Calculating adjusted EBIT: 
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should start with unadjusted EBIT. To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 

Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 3: Multiplying the two
24% * 9396.196 = $2255.087 (in millions)

The next step is to add / subtract operating taxes:  Looking at the tax reconciliation table, we can see that there are federal taxes, state taxes, foreign taxes, ESOP taxes, and other taxes. Thinking through each tax and whether or not it impacts the operating business. Federal and state impact the domestic operating business, foreign taxes impact the foreign operating business, and an employee stock ownership plan also impacts the operations of the business (paying off employees). Other is not detailed, so we will assume it is not related to the operating business as it could be any changes. We already factored in the statutory taxes (federal and state) to see their impact on the operating business, so what is remaining are the foreign operating business taxes and ESOP taxes which are 109 and -120, respectively. 

Since the table provides the numerical quantities of taxes (in addition to the percentages), we can add them up with the number we got earlier (for statutory taxes on EBIT) to get operating taxes: 2255.087 + 109 - 120 = 2244.087

Part 2.
Calculate deferred tax expense: We do this by calculating the change in operating deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. 

Step 1. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2024: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2024, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL)

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 96 + 313  +678 + 873 - 494 - 948 - 296 - 652 - 105 = -535

Step 2. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2023: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2023, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL). Foreign Branch deferreds are also considered operating because they are tied to the core operations in foreign countries and arise from accounting differences. 

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 89 + 309  +678 + 761 - 422 - 867 - 380 - 655 - 87 = -574

Calculating the change from 2023 to 2024, which is the deferred tax expense: -535 - (-574) = +39

Finally, to calculate operating cash tax in 2024, you add the deferred tax expense to the operating tax, so 2244.0871 + 39 = $2283.0871 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","Calculate Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities in 2024","To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2024, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL)

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 96 + 313  +678 + 873 - 494 - 948 - 296 - 652 - 105 = -$535 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","Calculate Operating Deferred Tax Asset, net of deferred tax liabilities in 2023","To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2023, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL). Foreign Branch deferreds are also considered operating because they are tied to the core operations in foreign countries and arise from accounting differences. 

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 89 + 309  +678 + 761 - 422 - 867 - 380 - 655 - 87 = -$574 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the operating cash tax rate in 2024?,"To calculate the operating cash tax rate, we need to divide the operating cash tax by adjusted EBIT. 

Task 1: Calculate Operating Cash Tax
To calculate operating cash taxes, we need to consider non-cash tax payments that might be included in the operating cash tax.

Part 1. Calculate operating taxes: 
To calculate operating taxes, we need to find the statutory taxes on EBIT and then add / subtract additional operating taxes. 

The first step to do is calculate the statutory taxes on EBIT: 
To calculate the statutory taxes, we multiply the marginal tax rate by adjusted EBIT. 
Step 1: Calculating marginal tax rate: 
The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%

Step 2: Calculating adjusted EBIT: 
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should start with unadjusted EBIT. To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 

Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 3: Multiplying the two
24% * 9396.196 = $2255.087 (in millions)

The next step is to add / subtract operating taxes:  Looking at the tax reconciliation table, we can see that there are federal taxes, state taxes, foreign taxes, ESOP taxes, and other taxes. Thinking through each tax and whether or not it impacts the operating business. Federal and state impact the domestic operating business, foreign taxes impact the foreign operating business, and an employee stock ownership plan also impacts the operations of the business (paying off employees). Other is not detailed, so we will assume it is not related to the operating business as it could be any changes. We already factored in the statutory taxes (federal and state) to see their impact on the operating business, so what is remaining are the foreign operating business taxes and ESOP taxes which are 109 and -120, respectively. 

Since the table provides the numerical quantities of taxes (in addition to the percentages), we can add them up with the number we got earlier (for statutory taxes on EBIT) to get operating taxes: 2255.087 + 109 - 120 = 2244.087

Part 2.
Calculate deferred tax expense: We do this by calculating the change in operating deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. 

Step 1. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2024: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2024, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL)

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 96 + 313  +678 + 873 - 494 - 948 - 296 - 652 - 105 = -535

Step 2. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2023: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2023, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL). Foreign Branch deferreds are also considered operating because they are tied to the core operations in foreign countries and arise from accounting differences. 

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 89 + 309  +678 + 761 - 422 - 867 - 380 - 655 - 87 = -574

Calculating the change from 2023 to 2024, which is the deferred tax expense: -535 - (-574) = +39

Finally, to calculate operating cash tax in 2024, you add the deferred tax expense to the operating tax, so 2244.0871 + 39 = 2283.0871

Task 2: Calculate Adjusted EBIT
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should first start with unadjusted EBIT and then make adjustments that make sense. 

The first step is to get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we know that EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

The second step is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to look for other interest expenses or tax expenses that need to be added back if they were included in EBIT.  One common embedded interest expense is operating lease expense from the newer accounting rules. Looking at Note 5 - Leases, we also see variable leases, so we need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). 

To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, We don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, we do see a variable lease cost line item, so we will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). However, this is still an assumption being made. Consequently, we take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBIT + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = $9396.1963 (in millions)

Task 3: Calculating operating cash tax rate
Operating cash tax rate = operating cash tax / adjusted EBIT = 2283.0871 / 9396.193 = 24.3%

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Determine the Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding in 2024.,"Step 1: Identify the Formula Components

Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)

Step 2: Find Common Stock Outstanding

I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding

Step 3: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.

Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.

Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 

Step 4: Apply the Formula

Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 443,073,537 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000 shares outstanding","445,592,000",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

_______________
(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate the Unlevered Beta for 2024.,"To compute Unlevered Beta, we use the formula: Unlevered Beta = Levered beta / [1 + (1 - tax rate) * (Debt / Equity)]. 

Step 1: Find Levered Beta and Tax Rate
Beta is provided to be 0.79. We use the effective tax rate, which is given in Note 8—Taxes as 24.4%. 

Step 2: Compute Debt
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 2a: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 

Step 2b: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 

Step 2c: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052. + 1,466 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 3: Compute Equity
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 3a. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 3a.1: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 3a.2: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 3a.c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 3a.4: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 3b. Find the Price per Share and Apply Formula
Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Step 4: Apply Formula
Levered beta / [1 + (1 - tax rate) * (Debt / Equity)] = 0.79 / [1 + (1 - 0.244) * (11,414.85/418,856)] = 0.77",0.77,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

$ 452 $ —
Capital expenditures included in liabilities $ 203 $ 170 $ 156Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation
The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Compute Debt for 2024. Include Debt Equivalents.,"To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 

Step 2: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 

Step 3: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,465.85 = $11,414.85 (in millions).","$11,415 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

_______________
(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",How much cash and cash equivalents did Costco have at year end 2024?,"To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)","$11,144 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but
not yet delivered.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Compute Net Debt for 2024.,"To compute Net Debt for 2024, we use the formula: Net Debt = Sum of all debt - cash and cash equivalents. 

Step 1: Compute Debt
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1a: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 

Step 1b: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 

Step 1c: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,465.85 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 2: Compute Cash and Cash Equivalents
To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)

Step 3: Apply Formula
Net Debt = $11,414.85 - $11,144 = $271 (in millions)",$271 (in millions),https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Net deferred tax liabilities $ (221) $ (304)
The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the Book Value of Equity in 2024?,"Book Value of Equity is the Equity Value provided on the Balance Sheet.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate ROIC for 2024.,"To compute 2024 ROIC, we need two figures: 2024 NOPAT and Average Invested Capital (from 2023 and 2024)
2024 NOPAT CALCULATION:
To compute NOPAT for 2024, we use the formula: NOPAT = EBIT * (1- Operating Cash Tax Rate) or EBIT - Operating Cash Taxes.

Task 1: Calculating Adjusted EBIT
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should first start with unadjusted EBIT and then make adjustments that make sense. 

The first step is to get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we know that EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

The second step is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to look for other interest expenses or tax expenses that need to be added back if they were included in EBIT.  One common embedded interest expense is operating lease expense from the newer accounting rules. Looking at Note 5 - Leases, we also see variable leases, so we need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). 

To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, We don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, we do see a variable lease cost line item, so we will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). However, this is still an assumption being made. Consequently, we take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBIT + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = $9396.1963 (in millions)

Task 2: Calculating Operating Cash Taxes
To calculate operating cash taxes, we need to consider non-cash tax payments that might be included in the operating cash tax, so taking operating cash tax and adding deferred tax expense.

Part 1. Calculate operating taxes: 
To calculate operating taxes, we need to find the statutory taxes on EBIT and then add / subtract additional operating taxes. 

The first step to do is calculate the statutory taxes on EBIT: 
To calculate the statutory taxes, we multiply the marginal tax rate by adjusted EBIT. 
Step 1: Calculating marginal tax rate: 
The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%

Step 2: Calculating adjusted EBIT: 
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should start with unadjusted EBIT. To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 

Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 3: Multiplying the two
24% * 9396.196 = $2255.087 (in millions)

The next step is to add / subtract operating taxes:  Looking at the tax reconciliation table, we can see that there are federal taxes, state taxes, foreign taxes, ESOP taxes, and other taxes. Thinking through each tax and whether or not it impacts the operating business. Federal and state impact the domestic operating business, foreign taxes impact the foreign operating business, and an employee stock ownership plan also impacts the operations of the business (paying off employees). Other is not detailed, so we will assume it is not related to the operating business as it could be any changes. We already factored in the statutory taxes (federal and state) to see their impact on the operating business, so what is remaining are the foreign operating business taxes and ESOP taxes which are 109 and -120, respectively. 

Since the table provides the numerical quantities of taxes (in addition to the percentages), we can add them up with the number we got earlier (for statutory taxes on EBIT) to get operating taxes: 2255.087 + 109 - 120 = 2244.087

Part 2.
Calculate deferred tax expense: We do this by calculating the change in operating deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. 

Step 1. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2024: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2024, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL)

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 96 + 313  +678 + 873 - 494 - 948 - 296 - 652 - 105 = -535

Step 2. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2023: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2023, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL). Foreign Branch deferreds are also considered operating because they are tied to the core operations in foreign countries and arise from accounting differences. 

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 89 + 309  +678 + 761 - 422 - 867 - 380 - 655 - 87 = -574

Calculating the change from 2023 to 2024, which is the deferred tax expense: -535 - (-574) = +39

Finally, to calculate operating cash tax in 2024, you add the deferred tax expense to the operating tax, so 2244.0871 + 39 = 2283.0871

Task 3: Calculating NOPAT, NOPAT = EBIT - Operating Cash Tax
NOPAT = 9396.1963 - 2283.0871 = $7,113.11 (in millions).

AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL CALCULATION:
To compute the average of invested capital over the past 2 years, we need to find invested capital for 2023 and 2024:
Invested Capital for 2023:
 To compute invested capital with goodwill, we need to add all operating assets and subtract all operating liabilities of the company. We can think about this in terms of operating working capital (current) and long-term operating assets minus long-term operating liabilities.
Task 1: calculate operating working capital for 2023
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2023, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Compute Operating Current Assets
To compute Operating Current Assets, we use the formula: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 35,879, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. 

Given Operating Cash isn't provided, we assume Operating Cash to be 2% of 2023 Revenue, or 242,290 * 0.02 = 4845.8. No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating.

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 4845.8 + 2285 + 16651 + 1709 = 25,490.8. 

Step 2: Compute Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we use the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. 

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. 

So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502. 

Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + 6,254 = 32,502. However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities.

Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 220 for operating lease liabilities and 129 for finance lease liabilities. So in reality, the operating current liability is 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + (6,254 - 220 - 129) = 32,153 Hence Operating Working Capital = 25,490.8 - 32,153 = -$6,662.2 (in millions).

Task 2: Calculating Long-term operating assets, net of long-term operating liabilities
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2023.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
26,684 + 2,713 + 1404.78964 + 1,325 + 994 + 908 = $34,028.7896 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-tern Operating Liabilities for 2023. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 34,028.7896 -  452 = $33,577 (in millions)

Task 3: Adding operating short-term and long-term assets, net of liabilities to get to invested capital
Invested Capital = -6662.2 + 33576.7896 = $26,915 (in millions) 

 Invested Capital for 2024:
To compute invested capital with goodwill, we need to add all operating assets and subtract all operating liabilities of the company. We can think about this in terms of operating working capital (current) and long-term operating assets minus long-term operating liabilities.
Task 1: calculate operating working capital for 2024
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2024, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Calculate Operating Current Asset
To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)

Step 2: Calculate Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)

Step 3: Apply Formula
Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities
Operating Working Capital = 28,191 - 35,035 = -$6,844 (in millions)

Task 2: Calculating Long-term operating assets, net of long-term operating liabilities
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2024.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = 961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
29,032 + 2,617 + 1502 + 1,433 + 994 + 961 = $36,539 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2024. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 36,539 -  456 = $36,083 (in millions)

Task 3: Adding operating short-term and long-term assets, net of liabilities to get to invested capital
Invested Capital = -6,844 + 36083 = $29,239 (in millions) 

Finally, we take the average: (29,239 + 26,915) / 2 = $28,077 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","Determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.","To compute invested capital with goodwill, we need to add all operating assets and subtract all operating liabilities of the company. We can think about this in terms of operating working capital (current) and long-term operating assets minus long-term operating liabilities.
Task 1: calculate operating working capital for 2024
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2024, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Calculate Operating Current Asset
To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)

Step 2: Calculate Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)

Step 3: Apply Formula
Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities
Operating Working Capital = 28,191 - 35,035 = -$6,844 (in millions)

Task 2: Calculating Long-term operating assets, net of long-term operating liabilities
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2024.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = 961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
29,032 + 2,617 + 1502 + 1,433 + 994 + 961 = $36,539 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2024. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 36,539 -  456 = $36,083 (in millions)

Task 3: Adding operating short-term and long-term assets, net of liabilities to get to invested capital
Invested Capital = -6,844 + 36083 = $29,239 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","Determine Invested Capital excluding Goodwill for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.","To compute invested capital without goodwill, we need to add all operating assets and subtract all operating liabilities of the company, except for goodwill. We can think about this in terms of operating working capital (current) and long-term operating assets minus long-term operating liabilities.
Task 1: calculate operating working capital for 2024
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2024, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Calculate Operating Current Asset
To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)

Step 2: Calculate Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)

Step 3: Apply Formula
Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities
Operating Working Capital = 28,191 - 35,035 = -$6,844 (in millions)

Task 2: Calculating Long-term operating assets, net of long-term operating liabilities
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2024.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = 961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets (Note: we don't add goodwill despite it being an operating asset because the question asked to exclude goodwill)
29,032 + 2,617 + 1502 + 1,433 + 961 = $35,545 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2024. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 35,545 -  456 = $35,089 (in millions)

Task 3: Adding operating short-term and long-term assets, net of liabilities to get to invested capital
Invested Capital = -6,844 + $35,089 = $28,245 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","Determine Invested Capital including Goodwill for 2023, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash.","To compute invested capital with goodwill, we need to add all operating assets and subtract all operating liabilities of the company. We can think about this in terms of operating working capital (current) and long-term operating assets minus long-term operating liabilities.
Task 1: calculate operating working capital for 2023
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2023, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Compute Operating Current Assets
To compute Operating Current Assets, we use the formula: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 35,879, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. 

Given Operating Cash isn't provided, we assume Operating Cash to be 2% of 2023 Revenue, or 242,290 * 0.02 = 4845.8. No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating.

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 4845.8 + 2285 + 16651 + 1709 = 25,490.8. 

Step 2: Compute Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we use the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. 

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. 

So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502. 

Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + 6,254 = 32,502. However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities.

Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 220 for operating lease liabilities and 129 for finance lease liabilities. So in reality, the operating current liability is 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + (6,254 - 220 - 129) = 32,153 Hence Operating Working Capital = 25,490.8 - 32,153 = -$6,662.2 (in millions).

Task 2: Calculating Long-term operating assets, net of long-term operating liabilities
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2023.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
26,684 + 2,713 + 1404.78964 + 1,325 + 994 + 908 = $34,028.7896 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2023. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 34,028.7896 -  452 = $33,577 (in millions)

Task 3: Adding operating short-term and long-term assets, net of liabilities to get to invested capital
Invested Capital = -6662.2 + 33576.7896 = $26,915 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Determine the Average Invested Capital (includes Goodwill) over 2023 and 2024.,"To compute the average of invested capital over the past 2 years, we need to find invested capital for 2023 and 2024:
Invested Capital for 2023:
 To compute invested capital with goodwill, we need to add all operating assets and subtract all operating liabilities of the company. We can think about this in terms of operating working capital (current) and long-term operating assets minus long-term operating liabilities.
Task 1: calculate operating working capital for 2023
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2023, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Compute Operating Current Assets
To compute Operating Current Assets, we use the formula: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 35,879, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. 

Given Operating Cash isn't provided, we assume Operating Cash to be 2% of 2023 Revenue, or 242,290 * 0.02 = 4845.8. No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating.

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 4845.8 + 2285 + 16651 + 1709 = 25,490.8. 

Step 2: Compute Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we use the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. 

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. 

So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502. 

Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + 6,254 = 32,502. However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities.

Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 220 for operating lease liabilities and 129 for finance lease liabilities. So in reality, the operating current liability is 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + (6,254 - 220 - 129) = 32,153 Hence Operating Working Capital = 25,490.8 - 32,153 = -$6,662.2 (in millions).

Task 2: Calculating Long-term operating assets, net of long-term operating liabilities
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2023.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
26,684 + 2,713 + 1404.78964 + 1,325 + 994 + 908 = $34,028.7896 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2023. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 34,028.7896 -  452 = $33,577 (in millions)

Task 3: Adding operating short-term and long-term assets, net of liabilities to get to invested capital
Invested Capital = -6662.2 + 33576.7896 = $26,915 (in millions) 

 Invested Capital for 2024:
To compute invested capital with goodwill, we need to add all operating assets and subtract all operating liabilities of the company. We can think about this in terms of operating working capital (current) and long-term operating assets minus long-term operating liabilities.
Task 1: calculate operating working capital for 2024
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2024, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Calculate Operating Current Asset
To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)

Step 2: Calculate Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)

Step 3: Apply Formula
Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities
Operating Working Capital = 28,191 - 35,035 = -$6,844 (in millions)

Task 2: Calculating Long-term operating assets, net of long-term operating liabilities
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2024.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = 961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
29,032 + 2,617 + 1502 + 1,433 + 994 + 961 = $36,539 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2024. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 36,539 -  456 = $36,083 (in millions)

Task 3: Adding operating short-term and long-term assets, net of liabilities to get to invested capital
Invested Capital = -6,844 + 36083 = $29,239 (in millions) 

Finally, we take the average: (29,239 + 26,915) / 2 = $28,077 (in millions)","$28,077 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the operating portion of long-term assets in 2024?,"Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2024.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = 961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
29,032 + 2,617 + 1502 + 1,433 + 994 + 961 = $36,539 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the operating portion of long-term assets in 2023?,"Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2023.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
26,684 + 2,713 + 1404.78964 + 1,325 + 994 + 908 = $34,028.7896 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","I see that there is a long-term assets line item. What is the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for, that we don't know what line item is is for, in 2024?","We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = $961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the operating portion of long-term liabilities in 2024?,"Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2024. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find other operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the operating portion of long-term liabilities in 2023?,"Let's calculate long-tern Operating Liabilities for 2023. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is the operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2024?","To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2024.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = 961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
29,032 + 2,617 + 1502 + 1,433 + 994 + 961 = $36,539 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-term Operating Liabilities for 2024. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is the operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities in 2023?","To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2023.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
26,684 + 2,713 + 1404.78964 + 1,325 + 994 + 908 = $34,028.7896 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-tern Operating Liabilities for 2023. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is the change in operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities from 2023 to 2024?","To calculate the change in the operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to calculate it for 2023 and 2024.
2023 Number Calculation:
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2023.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
26,684 + 2,713 + 1404.78964 + 1,325 + 994 + 908 = $34,028.7896 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-tern Operating Liabilities for 2023. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 34,028.7896 -  452 = $33,577 (in millions)

2024 Calculation:
To calculate operating portion of long-term assets, net long-term liabilities, we need to take operating long-term assets and subtract operating long-term liabilities. 

Part 1: Calculating Long-Term Operating Assets
Let's calculate long-term Operating Assets for 2024.

Step 1: Check to the Balance Sheet to find the long-term Operating Assets
On the Balance Sheet, under Other Assets we see Property and equipment, net, Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Other long-term assets. We know that PP&E, and Operating lease ROU assets are operating. However, Other long-term assets is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term assets to find unaccounted for other assets
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = 961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 4: Add all long-term operating assets together
Net PP&E + Operating Lease ROU Assets +  Variable Lease Assets + Finance Lease Assets  + Goodwill + Other Long Term Operating Current Assets
29,032 + 2,617 + 1502 + 1,433 + 994 + 961 = $36,539 (in millions) 

Part 2: Calculating Long-Term Operating Liabilities
Let's calculate long-tern Operating Liabilities for 2024. 

Step 1: Check the Balance Sheet
On the Balance Sheet I see long-term liabilities is made up of non-current Long-term debt, Long-term operating lease liabilities, and Other long-term liabilities. We know that long-term debt and long-term operating lease liabilities are not operational liabilities. However, Other long-term liabilities is not granular enough as we do not know what goes into this, which are current and which are non-current.

Step 2: Disaggregate Other long-term liabilities to find operating long-term liabilities.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Part 3: Subtracting the Two
Net Operating Capital = 36,539 -  456 = $36,083 (in millions)

Calculating the Change: 36,083 - 33,577 = $2,506 (in millions)

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is the portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for?","To calculate both portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for, we need to figure out the assets side and then the liability side: 

Step 1: We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.

From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets

Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.

Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.

To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = $961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.
Step 2: Disaggregating other long-term liabilities to find other operating long-term liabilities not accounted for.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.

From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Step 3: Apply formula for Net Non-current Operating Assets
Non-current Operating Assets, net of Non-current Operating Liabilities, = Non-current Operating Assets - Non-current Operating Liabilities = 961 - 456 = 505 (in millions).",$505 (in millions),https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","After separating other long-term assets, net of long-term liabilities to find what portion of that number is unaccounted for, can you measure the change between 2023 and 2024 for that operating metric?","To calculate the change from 2023 to 2024, we need to calculate the metric in 2024 and in 2023:

2024 portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for:
To calculate both portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for, we need to figure out the assets side and then the liability side: 

Step 1: We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.
From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets
Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.
Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.
To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = $961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 2: Disaggregating other long-term liabilities to find other operating long-term liabilities not accounted for.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.
From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 
To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Step 3: Apply formula for Net Non-current Operating Assets
Non-current Operating Assets, net of Non-current Operating Liabilities, = Non-current Operating Assets - Non-current Operating Liabilities = 961 - 456 = 505 (in millions).

2023 portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for:
To calculate both portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for, we need to figure out the assets side and then the liability side: 

Step 1: We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.
From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets
Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.
Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.
To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 2: Disaggregating Other long-term liabilities to find operating other long-term liabilities not accounted for 
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.
From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Step 3: Apply formula for Net Non-current Operating Assets
Non-current Operating Assets, net of Non-current Operating Liabilities, = Non-current Operating Assets - Non-current Operating Liabilities = 908 - 452 = 456 (in millions).

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate NOPAT for 2024. Make sure to make adjustments for one-time changes.,"To compute NOPAT for 2024, we use the formula: NOPAT = EBIT * (1- Operating Cash Tax Rate) or EBIT - Operating Cash Taxes.

Task 1: Calculating Adjusted EBIT
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should first start with unadjusted EBIT and then make adjustments that make sense. 

The first step is to get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we know that EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

The second step is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to look for other interest expenses or tax expenses that need to be added back if they were included in EBIT.  One common embedded interest expense is operating lease expense from the newer accounting rules. Looking at Note 5 - Leases, we also see variable leases, so we need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). 

To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, We don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, we do see a variable lease cost line item, so we will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). However, this is still an assumption being made. Consequently, we take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBIT + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = $9396.1963 (in millions)

Task 2: Calculating Operating Cash Taxes
To calculate operating cash taxes, we need to consider non-cash tax payments that might be included in the operating cash tax, so taking operating cash tax and adding deferred tax expense.

Part 1. Calculate operating taxes: 
To calculate operating taxes, we need to find the statutory taxes on EBIT and then add / subtract additional operating taxes. 

The first step to do is calculate the statutory taxes on EBIT: 
To calculate the statutory taxes, we multiply the marginal tax rate by adjusted EBIT. 
Step 1: Calculating marginal tax rate: 
The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%

Step 2: Calculating adjusted EBIT: 
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should start with unadjusted EBIT. To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 

Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 3: Multiplying the two
24% * 9396.196 = $2255.087 (in millions)

The next step is to add / subtract operating taxes:  Looking at the tax reconciliation table, we can see that there are federal taxes, state taxes, foreign taxes, ESOP taxes, and other taxes. Thinking through each tax and whether or not it impacts the operating business. Federal and state impact the domestic operating business, foreign taxes impact the foreign operating business, and an employee stock ownership plan also impacts the operations of the business (paying off employees). Other is not detailed, so we will assume it is not related to the operating business as it could be any changes. We already factored in the statutory taxes (federal and state) to see their impact on the operating business, so what is remaining are the foreign operating business taxes and ESOP taxes which are 109 and -120, respectively. 

Since the table provides the numerical quantities of taxes (in addition to the percentages), we can add them up with the number we got earlier (for statutory taxes on EBIT) to get operating taxes: 2255.087 + 109 - 120 = 2244.087

Part 2.
Calculate deferred tax expense: We do this by calculating the change in operating deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. 

Step 1. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2024: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2024, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL)

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 96 + 313  +678 + 873 - 494 - 948 - 296 - 652 - 105 = -535

Step 2. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2023: 
To calculate operating net DTA/DTL in 2023, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating and add the operating deferred tax assets and subtract the operating deferred tax liabilities.

Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL). Foreign Branch deferreds are also considered operating because they are tied to the core operations in foreign countries and arise from accounting differences. 

Net DTA/DTL = Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 89 + 309  +678 + 761 - 422 - 867 - 380 - 655 - 87 = -574

Calculating the change from 2023 to 2024, which is the deferred tax expense: -535 - (-574) = +39

Finally, to calculate operating cash tax in 2024, you add the deferred tax expense to the operating tax, so 2244.0871 + 39 = 2283.0871

Task 3: Calculating NOPAT, NOPAT = EBIT - Operating Cash Tax
NOPAT = 9396.1963 - 2283.0871 = $7,113.11 (in millions).","$7,113 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Estimate Variable Lease Assets in 2023,"Let's estimate Variable Lease Assets in 2023.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Estimate Variable Lease Assets in 2024,"Let's estimate Variable Lease Assets in 2024.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Estimate the change in variable lease assets from 2023 to 2024,"Let's estimate the change in variable lease assets from 2023 to 2024.

Step 1: Calculate 2023 Variable Lease Assets
For 2023,  In Note 5—Leases, we see there is Variable Lease Costs, which doesn't have a reported corresponding Variable Lease Assets, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2713) * (160 / 309) = 1,405.

Step 2: Calculate 2024 Variable Lease Assets
For 2024,  In Note 5—Leases, we see there is Variable Lease Costs, which doesn't have a reported corresponding Variable Lease Assets, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502.

Step 3: Find Change Variable Lease Assets
Change Variable Lease Assets = 1502 - 1405 = 97 (in millions).",$97 (in millions),https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024,"Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.

From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liab.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is operating cash for 2024? If there is no mention, assume it is the minimum of 2% of revenue and cash & cash equivalents.","Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. First, assume operating cash to be 2% of 2024 Revenue, or 254,453 * 0.02 = 5089.06. 
Next, To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.","$5,089 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is excess cash in 2024, given that operating cash is calculated as the minimum between taking 2% of revenue and cash.","Excess cash can be calculated by taking cash and cash equivalents and subtracting operating cash.
Step 1. Calculating operating cash. 
Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. First, assume operating cash to be 2% of 2024 Revenue, or 254,453 * 0.02 = 5089.06. 
Next, To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.
Step 2. Calculating Excess Cash
As given before, cash and cash equivalents is 11144, so excess cash is 11144 - 5089 = $6054.94 (in millions)","$6,055 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

_______________
(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is operating current assets in 2024, assuming that 2% of revenue is operating cash?","To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)","$28,191 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is operating current liability in 2024?,"To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)","$35,035 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is Operating Working Capital for 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash?","To compute Operating Working Capital for 2024, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Calculate Operating Current Asset
To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)

Step 2: Calculate Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)

Step 3: Apply Formula
Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities
Operating Working Capital = 28,191 - 35,035 = -$6,844 (in millions)","-$6,844 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is 2024 Interest Expense?,"To compute Interest Expense for 2024, we need to sum the interest expenses of all debt and debt equivalents.

From the balance sheet, we see there is long-term debt and operating lease liabilities. From Note 5—Leases, we see there are also finance lease liabilities. We also see there are variable lease costs, which should have similar variable lease liabilities. 

Hence we need to sum: long-term debt interest + operating lease liab. interest + finance lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest.

On the Income statement, I see interest expense of 169. I check for a corresponding note, and find an Interest Expense note under Results of Operations. It states that """"Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases."""" Hence, we should not separately calculate interest expense for financing leases. 

I check Note 4—Debt to see if there is any further color on interest from long-term debt. None is provided.

Next we need to find operating and variable lease interest expense. Checking Note 5—Leases, no details are provided. From Note 5, we know that the intrest expense is embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs. To calculate operating lease interest expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Hence we have Interest Expense = Interest Expense from Income Statement + operating lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest = 169 + 70.6482 + 40.548 = 280 (in millions).",$280 (in millions),https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate the EBIT Interest Coverage Ratio for 2024.,"To compute Interest Coverage Ratio, we use the formula:  Interest Coverage Ratio = adjusted EBIT / Interest Expense.

Step 1: Calculate adjusted EBIT:
To calculate adjusted EBIT, we should first start with unadjusted EBIT and then make adjustments that make sense. 

The first step is to get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we know that EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

The second step is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to look for other interest expenses or tax expenses that need to be added back if they were included in EBIT.  One common embedded interest expense is operating lease expense from the newer accounting rules. Looking at Note 5 - Leases, we also see variable leases, so we need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). 

To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, We don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, we do see a variable lease cost line item, so we will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). However, this is still an assumption being made. Consequently, we take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBIT + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = $9396.1963 (in millions)

Step 2: Calculate interest expense:
To compute Interest Expense for 2024, we need to sum the interest expenses of all debt and debt equivalents.

From the balance sheet, we see there is long-term debt and operating lease liabilities. From Note 5—Leases, we see there are also finance lease liabilities. We also see there are variable lease costs, which should have similar variable lease liabilities. 

Hence we need to sum: long-term debt interest + operating lease liab. interest + finance lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest.

On the Income statement, I see interest expense of 169. I check for a corresponding note, and find an Interest Expense note under Results of Operations. It states that ""Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases."" Hence, we should not separately calculate interest expense for financing leases. 

I check Note 4—Debt to see if there is any further color on interest from long-term debt. None is provided.

Next we need to find operating and variable lease interest expense. Checking Note 5—Leases, no details are provided. From Note 5, we know that the intrest expense is embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs. To calculate operating lease interest expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Hence we have Interest Expense = Interest Expense from Income Statement + operating lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest = 169 + 70.6482 + 40.548 = 280.1962

Step 3: Apply formula
Interest Coverage Ratio = adjusted EBIT / Interest Expense = 9396.1963 / 280.1962 = 33.53x.",33.53x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate the EBITA Interest Coverage Ratio for 2024.,"To compute EBITDA Interest Coverage Ratio, we use the formula:  Interest Coverage Ratio = adjusted EBITDA / Interest Expense.

Step 1: Calculate adjusted EBITA:
To calculate adjusted EBITDA, we should first start with unadjusted EBITDA and make adjustments that make sense, like one-time expenses or operating / variable lease costs since we are classifying them as debt equivalents.

First, let's find unadjusted EBITDA. Step 1: Identify the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = Unadjusted EBIT + Depreciation + Amortization

Step 2: Determine Unadjusted EBIT
Unadjusted EBIT equals Operating Income. I check the Income Statement, to find the Income Statement of $9,285

Step 3: Find Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and Amortization is found on the Cash Flow Statement. Checking the Cash Flow Statement, I see a Depreciation and amortization line item of $2,237

Step 4: Apply the Formula
Unadjusted EBITDA = $9,285 + $2,237
Unadjusted EBITDA = $11,522

The second part is to look for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. We could not find any mentions of those expenses in 2024.

Third, we need to add back operating and variable lease costs in EBITDA. This is because operating and variable leases expenses, which are embedded in merchandise costs or SG&A are composed of interest and depreciation / amortization of their respective asset. Since this is EBITDA, or before interest and depreciation, we can add the whole cost back. We do not need to add-back the amortization and interest of finance leases because the amortization is baked into the D&A expense (2,237), which was already added back. On the other hand, finance lease interest expense is stated to be included in interest expense and merchandise cost; since the allocation is not specificed, we assume that has already been factored into the interest expense line-item and does not need to be added back. 

Adding up everything together (unadjusted EBITDA + operating lease interest expense + variable lease interest expense): 11,522 + 284 + 163 = $11,969 (in millions)

Step 2: Calculate interest expense:
To compute Interest Expense for 2024, we need to sum the interest expenses of all debt and debt equivalents.

From the balance sheet, we see there is long-term debt and operating lease liabilities. From Note 5—Leases, we see there are also finance lease liabilities. We also see there are variable lease costs, which should have similar variable lease liabilities. 

Hence we need to sum: long-term debt interest + operating lease liab. interest + finance lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest.

On the Income statement, I see interest expense of 169. I check for a corresponding note, and find an Interest Expense note under Results of Operations. It states that """"Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases."""" Hence, we should not separately calculate interest expense for financing leases. 

I check Note 4—Debt to see if there is any further color on interest from long-term debt. None is provided.

Next we need to find operating and variable lease interest expense. Checking Note 5—Leases, no details are provided. From Note 5, we know that the intrest expense is embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs. To calculate operating lease interest expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Hence we have Interest Expense = Interest Expense from Income Statement + operating lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest = 169 + 70.6482 + 40.548 = 280.1962

Step 3: Apply formula
Interest Coverage Ratio = adjusted EBIT / Interest Expense = 11,969 / 280.1962 = 42.72x.",42.72x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.
The following table provides information for the Company's reportable segments:

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Determine ROA for 2024.,"The formula for ROA = [Net income + (1 - Income Tax Rate for Interest) * Interest Expense] / Average Total Assets. To calculate the numerator, I need net Income, interest expense, the income tax rate for interest as well as the average of 2023 and 2024 total assets for the denominator.

Step 1: I need to think about what interest expense to use. Interest expense for 2024 is 169; however, I know that it doesn't include operating or variable lease interest expense. Since the denominator of total assets will include right of use lease assets, I should add back the operating or lease interest expense numbers. 
To compute Interest Expense for 2024, we need to sum the interest expenses of all debt and debt equivalents.

From the balance sheet, we see there is long-term debt and operating lease liabilities. From Note 5—Leases, we see there are also finance lease liabilities. We also see there are variable lease costs, which should have similar variable lease liabilities. 

Hence we need to sum: long-term debt interest + operating lease liab. interest + finance lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest.

On the Income statement, I see interest expense of 169. I check for a corresponding note, and find an Interest Expense note under Results of Operations. It states that ""Interest expense is primarily related to Senior Notes and financing leases."" Hence, we should not separately calculate interest expense for financing leases. 

I check Note 4—Debt to see if there is any further color on interest from long-term debt. None is provided.

Next we need to find operating and variable lease interest expense. Checking Note 5—Leases, no details are provided. From Note 5, we know that the intrest expense is embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs. To calculate operating lease interest expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. 

Hence we have Interest Expense = Interest Expense from Income Statement + operating lease liab. interest + variable lease liab. interest = 169 + 70.6482 + 40.548 = 280.1962

Step 2: Use a tax rate to calculate the interest expense to add back. The effective tax rate reflects the cash saved from interest deductions, which is 24.4% from Note 8. 280.1962 * ( 1 - 24.4%) = 211.8283272

Step 3. Average the past 2 years of total assets (from the balance sheet) is (69,831 + 68,994) / 2 = 69412.5

Step 4: net income in 2024 is 7,367 (from income statement), so ROA = (7367 + 211.8283272 ) / (69412.5) = 11.31% ",11.31%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate ROE for 2024.,"To calculate ROE, we use the formula: ROE = (Net Income - Preferred Dividend) / Average Book Common Equity 

Step 1: Find numerator
From the Income statement, we find Net Income to be 7,367. I check the document for any details on a dividend to preferred stock holders. On the balance sheet I see that there are no preferred shares issued or outstanding. Note 6—Equity confirms this.

Step 2: Find denominator
From the balance sheet, 2024 total equity is 23,622 and 2023 total equity is 25,058. Hence Average Book Common Equity is (23,622+25,058)/2 = 24340

Step 3: Apply formula
ROE = (Net Income - Preferred Dividend) / Average Book Common Equity = (7,367 - 0) / 24340",30.27%,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is the Customer (Logo) Retention Rate in 2024?,"In Item 1—Business, it says that member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

(1) Executive members represented 35,400, 32,300, and 29,100 of total paid members in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:
2024 2023

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) for 2024.,"To calculate ARPU, I can take the Revenue of 2024 and then divide it by the average number of paid customers from 2023 and 2024.

Total revenue is 254453. Average number of paid customers is (76200 + 71000) / 2 = 73600.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What is revenue per store cut by geography in 2024?,"To calculate revenue per store cut by geography, I need to see how many stores are in each reported geography then find the corresponding revenue of each geography.

From Item 2—Properties, I see Costco operates 890 stores. 614 in US and Puerto Rico (""US""), 108 in Canada, and 168 in Other International. 

From Note 11—Segment Reporting, I see US revenue was 184,143, Canada 34,874, and other International 35,436 

Hence, Revenue per store in the US was 184,143 / 614 = $299.91, Canada was 34,874 / 108 = $322.91, and Other International was 35,436  / 168 = $210.93 (per store)",US: $299.91 per store; Canada: $322.91 per store; International: $210.93 per store,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The Company's effective tax rate in 2024 included discrete tax benefits of $94 related to the portion of the special dividend payable through the
Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

E-commerce _______________
(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What was Costco Sames Store Sales growth?,"To calculate Same Store Sales Growth, I first check if Costco reports Same Store Sales.

In the Overview section of Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations, I see that they report ""comparable sales"", which is defined as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for more than one year. This is equivalent to Same Stores Sales.

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

this cost will be recognized is 1.6 years. Included in the outstanding balance at the end of 2024 were approximately 908,000 RSUs vested but
not yet delivered.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",How many members churned in 2024?,"Let's calculate total # of churned members in 2024. 

I see that it is reported how many members Costco had in 2024 and 2023. 

In Item 1—Business, it says that member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. I assume 90.5% worldwide means all countries, including US and canada.

In Item 1—Business, I se that there were 71,000 total paid members in 2023 and 76,200 paid members in 2024. Assuming 90.5% retention, 71,000 * (1 - 0.905) = 6,745 paid members churned in 2024.","6,745",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",How many new members joined in 2024?,"Let's calculate how many members joined in 2024. 

I see that it is reported how many members Costco had in 2024 and 2023. However I need to see how many customers left in 2024 to really know how many customers joined.

In Item 1—Business, it says that member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. I assume 90.5% worldwide means all countries, including US and canada.

In Item 1—Business, I se that there were 71,000 total paid members in 2023 and 76,200 paid members in 2024. Assuming 90.5% retention, 71,000 * (1 - 0.905) = 6,745 paid members churned. This means 76,200 - 71,000 + 6,745 = 11,945 paid members joined in 2024.","11,945",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What's the operating working capital in 2023, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash?","To compute Operating Working Capital for 2023, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1: Compute Operating Current Assets
To compute Operating Current Assets, we use the formula: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 35,879, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. 

Given Operating Cash isn't provided, we assume Operating Cash to be 2% of 2023 Revenue, or 242,290 * 0.02 = 4845.8. No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating.

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 4845.8 + 2285 + 16651 + 1709 = 25,490.8. 

Step 2: Compute Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we use the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. 

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. 

So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502. 

Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + 6,254 = 32,502. However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities.

Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 220 for operating lease liabilities and 129 for finance lease liabilities. So in reality, the operating current liability is 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + (6,254 - 220 - 129) = 32,153 Hence Operating Working Capital = 25,490.8 - 32,153 = -$6,662.2 (in millions).","-$6,662 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.","What is the change in operating working capital from 2023 to 2024, using 2% of revenue as max potential operating cash?","To compute the change in Operating Working Capital in 2024 we apply the formula: 2024 Change in Operating Working Capital = 2024 Operating Working Capital - 2023 Operating Working Capital

Step 1: 
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2024, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1a: Calculate Operating Current Asset
To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)

Step 1b: Calculate Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)

Step 1c: Apply Formula
Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities
Operating Working Capital = 28,191 - 35,035 = -$6,844 (in millions)

Step 2: Compute 2023 Operating Working Capital
Step 2a: Compute Operating Current Assets
To compute Operating Current Assets, we use the formula: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 35,879, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. 

Given Operating Cash isn't provided, we assume Operating Cash to be 2% of 2023 Revenue, or 242,290 * 0.02 = 4845.8. No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating.

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 4845.8 + 2285 + 16651 + 1709 = 25,490.8. 

Step 2b: Compute Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we use the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. 

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. 

So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502. 

Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + 6,254 = 32,502. However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities.

Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 220 for operating lease liabilities and 129 for finance lease liabilities. So in reality, the operating current liability is 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + (6,254 - 220 - 129) = 32,153 Hence Operating Working Capital = 25,490.8 - 32,153 = -$6,662.2 (in millions).

Step 3: Find Change in Operating Working Capital:
Change in 2024 operating working capital = -6,844 - (-6,662) = -$182 (in millions). ",-$182 (in millions),https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Compute UFCF (Unlevered Free Cash Flow) for 2024.,"To calculate unlevered free cash flow, we will apply the formula: UFCF = NOPAT + D&A - Capex - change in operating working capital - change in not yet unaccounted for long-term operating assets, net of unaccounted for long-term operating liabilities (operating leases, variable leases, finance leases, goodwill, other, etc.)

We need to calculate NOPAT, D&A, Capex, the change in operating working capital, and the change in other line items to adjust for cash changes if they haven't already been made in EBIT. (ex: goodwill, operating lease ROU assets, variable lease assets, finance lease assets, and other assets, etc.)

First, is NOPAT: To compute NOPAT for 2024, we use the formula: NOPAT = EBIT * (1- Operating Cash Tax Rate) or EBIT - Operating Cash Taxes

Step 1: Calculating Adjusted EBIT: To calculate adjusted EBIT, we need to start with unadjusted EBIT and then make adjustments. To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 

Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 

Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 2: Calculating Cash Operating Taxes: To calculate operating cash taxes, we need to consider non-cash tax payments that might be included in the operating cash tax.

First, let's calculate operating taxes: To calculate operating taxes, we need to find the statutory taxes specifically on EBIT and then add / subtract additional operating taxes. 

The first thing to do is calculate the statutory taxes on EBIT: To calculate the statutory taxes, we multiply the marginal tax rate by adjusted EBIT: 
Step 1: Calculating marginal tax rate: The marginal tax rate can be calculated by adding up federal, state, and local taxes. In the tax table, federal taxes are at 21% and state taxes are at 3%. There is no line item for local taxes, so the marginal tax rate is 21 + 3 = 24%
Step 2: Calculating adjusted EBIT: To get unadjusted EBIT for 2024, we use the formula: EBIT = Operating Income. We find Operating Income on the Income Statement to be 9,285. 
Looking for one-time expenses, like write-downs, mark-downs, restructuring and legal fees, etc. Did not find any. 
Looking for other interest expenses that need to be added back. We need to add back operating and variable lease interest expense, since they are embedded in SG&A and merchandise costs (unlike finance interest lease expense, which is included in interest expense). To calculate operating lease expense, we can take the weighted average discount rate of the operating lease and multiply it by the previous year end's operating lease liability. The total operating lease liability from the previous year is the current + long-term, so (220 + 2426 = 2646). Then multiply it by the the weighted-average discount rate of this year, which is 2.67%. 2646 * 2.67% = 70.6482. To calculate variable interest expense, I don't see a line item for variable lease liability nor a weighted average discount rate for variable leases. However, I do see a variable lease cost line item, so I will use the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs to estimate the interest expense. This assumes that the discount rate between the two is equal, which is reasonable because both follow similar rules of an operating lease (both have no ownership of the asset after the lease term). We can take the 70.6482 and multiply it by the ratio of variable lease costs to operating lease costs, so 70.6482 * (163/284) = 40.548. Adding up everything together: 9285 + 40.548 + 70.6482 = 9396.1963

Step 3: Multiplying the two
24% * 9396.196 = 2255.087

The next step is to add / subtract operating taxes:  Looking at the tax reconciliation table, we can see that there are federal taxes, state taxes, foreign taxes, ESOP taxes, and other taxes. Thinking through each tax and whether or not it impacts the operating business. Federal and state impact the domestic operating business, foreign taxes impact the foreign operating business, and an employee stock ownership plan also impacts the operations of the business (paying off employees). Other is not detailed, so we will assume it is not related to the operating business as it could be any changes. We already factored in the statutory taxes (federal and state) to see their impact on the operating business, so what is remaining are the foreign operating business taxes and ESOP taxes. 

Since the table provides the numerical quantities of taxes (in addition to the percentages), we can add them up with the number we got earlier (for statutory taxes on EBIT) to get operating taxes: 2255.087 + 109 - 120 = 2244.087

Second, let's calculate non-cash operating tax payments: We do this by calculating the change in operating deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2024: To calculate operating net DTA/DTL, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating. 
Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL)
Calculating Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 96 + 313  +678 + 873 - 494 - 948 - 296 - 652 - 105 = -535

Calculating operating DTA, net of DTL in 2023: To calculate operating net DTA/DTL, we need to figure out which line-items in the deferred tax table should be considered operating vs non-operating. 
Looking through the list of items, foreign tax credit carryforwards are not considering operating assets because they arise from jurisdictional tax rules (cross-border taxation) rather than operational performance or temporary accounting differences. Additionally, the other line item will be classified as non-operating as well because they aren't directly linked to an operational aspect of the company and do not demonstrate any sort of scaling with line items like revenue (which would help prove that it is an operating DTA/DTL). Foreign Branch deferreds are also considered operating because they are tied to the core operations in foreign countries and arise from accounting differences. 
Calculating Operating DTA - Operating DTL: 89 + 309  +678 + 761 - 422 - 867 - 380 - 655 - 87 = -574

Calculating the change from 2023 to 2024: -535 - (-574) = +39

Finally, to calculate operating cash tax in 2024, you add the change to the operating tax, so 2244.0871 + 39 = 2283.0871

To calculate NOPAT = adjusted EBIT - Operating Cash Taxes = 9396 - 2283 = $7,113 (in millions).

Next, find out depreciation, which is 2,237, according to the Cash flow statement.

Next, find out Capital Expenditures (CapEx), which is -4710, according to the cash flow statement

Next, find out the change in operating working capital:

To compute change in Operating Working Capital in 2024 we apply the formula: 2024 Change in Operating Working Capital = 2024 Operating Working Capital - 2023 Operating Working Capital

Step 1: 
To compute Operating Working Capital for 2024, we use the formula: Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities. 

Step 1a: Calculate Operating Current Asset
To compute Operating Current Assets, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current assets from current assets: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. Or we need to add all operating current assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 34,246, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. 

To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.

No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating. 

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 5089 + 2721 + 18647 + 1734 = $28,191 (in millions)

Step 1b: Calculate Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we need to either subtract out the non-operating current liabilities from current liabilities:Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. Or we need to add all current operating liabilities together.

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 35,464 - 103 = 35361. Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + 6,210 = 35361. 

However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities. Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 179 for operating lease liabilities and 147 for finance lease liabilities. Operating and finance lease liabilities are not operating liabilities because they are essentially debt equivalents, so in reality, the operating current liability is 19,421 +  4,794 +  2,435 +  2,501 + (6,210 - 179 - 147) = $35,035 (in millions)

Step 1c: Apply Formula
Operating Working Capital = Operating Current Assets - Operating Current Liabilities
Operating Working Capital = 28,191 - 35,035 = -$6,844 (in millions)

Step 2: Compute 2023 Operating Working Capital
Step 2a: Compute Operating Current Assets
To compute Operating Current Assets, we use the formula: Operating Current Assets = Current Assets - Non-Operating Current Assets. 

From the Balance Sheet, we find Total Current Assets to be 35,879, which is made up of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Receivables, net, Merchandise inventories, and Other current assets. We remove Short-term investments, which is non-operating, and non-operating cash. 

Given Operating Cash isn't provided, we assume Operating Cash to be 2% of 2023 Revenue, or 242,290 * 0.02 = 4845.8. No description of Other current assets is provided so we assume they are operating.

We use the new formula of Operating Current Assets = Operating Cash + Net Receivables + Inventory + Other Current Assets = 4845.8 + 2285 + 16651 + 1709 = 25,490.8. 

Step 2b: Compute Operating Current Liabilities
To compute Operating Current Liabilities, we use the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Current Liabilities - Non-Operating Current Liabilities. 

From the Balance Sheet we find Current Liabilities to be made up of Accounts payable, Accrued salaries and benefits, Accrued member rewards, Deferred membership fees, Current portion of long-term debt, and Other current liabilities. All of these liabilities are operating other than the current portion of long-term debt. 

So we apply the formula: Operating Current Liabilities = Total Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt = 33,583 - 1,081 = 32,502. 

Alternatively, we could have used: Operating Current Liabilities = Accounts payable + Accrued salaries and benefits + Accrued member rewards + Deferred membership fees + Other current liabilities = 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + 6,254 = 32,502. However, we also need to realize that other current liabilities could be composed of non operating liabilities.

Taking a closer look, other current liabilities also includes operating and finance leases, which in Note 5 are 220 for operating lease liabilities and 129 for finance lease liabilities. So in reality, the operating current liability is 17,483 +  4,278 +  2,150 +  2,337 + (6,254 - 220 - 129) = 32,153 Hence Operating Working Capital = 25,490.8 - 32,153 = -$6,662.2 (in millions).

Step 3: Find Change in Operating Working Capital:
Change in 2024 operating working capital = -6,844 - (-6,662) = -$182 (in millions). 

Next are changes to reflect actual cash flow changes. On the non-operating side,
We have changes in operating leases assets: 2,617 - 2,713 = -96
We have changes in finance lease assets: 1,433 - 1,325 = 108
We have changes in variable lease assets: For 2023,  In Note 5—Leases, we see there is Variable Lease Costs, which doesn't have a reported corresponding Variable Lease Assets, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.79.

For 2024,  In Note 5—Leases, we see there is Variable Lease Costs, which doesn't have a reported corresponding Variable Lease Assets, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502.
The change is 1502 - 1404.79 = 97.22 
We have changes in goodwill (since we did not factor in goodwill into EBIT): 944 - 944 = 0.

Finally, we need to account for other operating asset and liabilities that might be buried in the other long-term assets or other long-term liabilities line item:
To calculate the change from 2023 to 2024, we need to calculate the metric in 2024 and in 2023:
2024 portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for:
To calculate both portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for, we need to figure out the assets side and then the liability side: 

Step 1: We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.
From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,433) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2617) * (163 / 284) = 1502. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets
Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.
Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 548, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.
To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 1502 - 994 - 548 = -541. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,936 - 1,433 - 994 - 548 = $961 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 2: Disaggregating other long-term liabilities to find other operating long-term liabilities not accounted for.
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.
From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,351, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 769, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 
To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,576 - 1,351 - 1,465.85 - 769 = -1009.85. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,576 - 1,351 - 769 = -$456 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Step 3: Apply formula for Net Non-current Operating Assets
Non-current Operating Assets, net of Non-current Operating Liabilities, = Non-current Operating Assets - Non-current Operating Liabilities = 961 - 456 = 505 (in millions).

2023 portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for:
To calculate both portion of other long-term assets that's not accounted for in 2024, net of the portion of other long-term operating liabilities not accounted for, we need to figure out the assets side and then the liability side: 

Step 1: We try to break out the portion of Other long-term assets, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term assets, we will assume the remaining of the assets which we don't know are operating. We should look for which assets are under other long term assets.
From Note 5—Leases we know that Costco also has Finance lease assets (of 1,325) as well as Variable lease costs, which lead to Variable lease assets. Variable lease assets aren't provided directly, so we estimate Variable Lease Assets by using the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs. Variable lease assets. = Operating lease assets. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (2,713) * (160 / 309) = 1404.78964. We assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets
Further, from Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, we know Costco has Goodwill of 994, which falls under other long-term assets.
Further, from Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has a Deferred Income Tax Asset of 491, which also falls under other long-term assets. Deferred income tax asset is non-operating.
To find the unaccounted for other assets, we take Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Variable Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 1404.78964 - 994 - 491 = -496.8. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term assets and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet .Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term assets - Finance Lease Assets - Goodwill - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 3,718 - 1,325 - 994 - 491 = 908 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating.

Step 2: Disaggregating Other long-term liabilities to find operating other long-term liabilities not accounted for 
We try to break out the portion of Other long-term liabilities, which we know. Given Costco didn't provide commentary on what is in Other long-term liabilities, we will assume the remaining of the liabilities which we don't know are operating.
From Note 5—Leases, we know Costco has long-term finance lease liability of 1,303, which is non operating.
From Note 8—Taxes, we know Costco has deferred income tax liabilities of 795, which is non operating.
We also see variable lease liability is not accounted for anywhere, so let's assume that these variable leases are included in other long-term assets. Let's estimate Variable Lease Liability in 2024.
From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liab. Hence, I take the ratio of Operating lease costs to Variable lease costs to estimate Variable lease liab., where Variable lease liab. = Operating lease liab. * (Variable lease costs / Operating lease costs) = (220 + 2,426) * (160 / 309) = 1,370.097 (in millions), where Operating lease liab. is the sum of current operating lease liab. and long-term operating lease liability. 

To find the unaccounted for other liabilities, we take Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liability - Variable Lease liability - Deferred Income Tax Liability = 2,550 - 1,303 - 1,370.097 - 795 = -918.097. 
However, this asset cannot be negative. Checking again, we see that Variable Lease Assets (and the corresponding Variable Lease Liability) were never capitalized on the balance sheet. So, we take back the assumption that it should be in other long-term liabilities and instead just wasn't capitalized on the balance sheet. Hence, we shouldn't include them in this calculation.
Our new formula is Other long-term liabilities - Finance Lease liabilities  - Deferred Income Tax Asset = 2,550 - 1,303  - 795 = -$452 (in millions) of unaccounted for other long-term assets that we assume to be operating. 

Step 3: Apply formula for Net Non-current Operating Assets
Non-current Operating Assets, net of Non-current Operating Liabilities, = Non-current Operating Assets - Non-current Operating Liabilities = 908 - 452 = 456 (in millions).

2024 - 2023 Portion = 505 -456 = $49 (in millions) 

Final Step: Apply UFCF Formula
To put it all together: NOPAT + D&A - change in working capital - capex - change in operating leases - change in variable leases - change in finance leases - change in goodwill - change in noncurrent other operating assets, net of liabilities
=7113 +2237-(-181.8) - 4710 - 97.22 - (-96) - 108 - 0 - 49 = UFCF = $4,663.58 (in millions)

Note: since we did not include any changes in goodwill when adjusting EBIT, we make changes for it after calculating NOPAT
Note: we also chose not to add-back SBC since we believe it is a substantial and real expense for Costco","$4,664 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate levered free cash flow for 2024.,"To compute Levered Free Cash Flow (LFCF) for 2024, we apply the formula: LFCF = CFO - Capex + Net Borrowing.

Step 1: Get Items from Cash Flow Statement
CFO and CapEx are both Cash Flow Statement line items. Checking there, we find CFO (Net Cash from Operating Activities) of $11,339 and Capital Expenditures of $4,710.  
For the 52 weeks ended September 1, 2024 (in millions of USD):

Step 2: Calculate Net Borrowing
We want to calculate Debt & Lease-Related Financing Flows which we will find under the Cash Flow from Financing section of the Cash Flow Statement. 

Checking there, we see:

$920 Short-term borrowings repayment (outflow) and $928 short-term borrowings proceeds (inflow) = +$8 of Net Short-term Borrowings
$1,077 long-term debt repayment (outflow) and $498 long-term debt proceeds (inflow) = -$579 Net Long-term debt proceeds 
We also see a line item of “Financing lease payments and other financing activities, net"" of -$137, which we assume to primarily be finance lease principal. 

Hence, Net Borrowings = 8 + (-579) + (-137) = -708
This is a net outflow of $708 million, meaning Costco repaid more debt and finance lease principal than it raised in new debt.

Step 3: Apply formula
LFCF = CFO−CapEx+Net Borrowings = 11,339 - 4,710 + (-708) = $5,921 (in millions).","$5,921 (in millions)",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate Accounts Receivables Days for 2024.,"To calculate Accounts Receivables Days I will apply the formula: AR Days = Average. Accounts Receivable / (Sales / 365). 

From the Balance Sheet, I see 2024 Accounts Receivables was 2,721 and 2023 Accounts Receivables was 2,285.

From the Income Statement, I see total revenue in 2024 was 254,453.

Hence, AR Days is ((2,721 + 2,285)/2) / (254,453/365) = 3.59x.",3.59x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate Accounts Payables Days for 2024.,"To calculate Accounts Payable Days I will apply the formula: AP Days = Average. Accounts Payables / (COGS / 365). 

From the Balance Sheet, I see 2024 Accounts Payables was 19,421 and 2023 Accounts Receivables was 17,483.

From the Income Statement, I see merchandise costs was 222,358. 

Hence, AP Days is ((19,421+ 17,483)/2) / (222,358/365) = 30.29x.",30.29x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

_______________
(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate Inventory Turnover for 2024.,"Let's calculate how many members joined in 2024. 

I see that it is reported how many members Costco had in 2024 and 2023. However I need to see how many cusotmers left in 2024 to really know how many customers joined.

In Item 1—Business, it says that member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. I assume 90.5% worldwide means all countries, including US and canada.

In Item 1—Business, I se that there were 71,000 total paid members in 2023 and 76,200 paid members in 2024. Assuming 90.5% retention, 71,000 * (1 - 0.905) = 6,745 paid members churned. This means 76,200 - 71,000 + 6,745 = 11,945 paid members joined in 2024.",12.6x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable

assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Determine the EV/Sales ratio for 2024.,"I will calculate EV / Sales by using the equation: EV/Sales = Enterprise Value / Total Revenue.

Step 1: Calculate Enterprise Value
To calculate enterprise value, we can use the formula for EV = Equity Value + Debt / Debt Equivalents + Preferred Equity + MInority Interest - Excess Cash. We would also subtract any other non-operating assets, and the question lets us assume that the only non-operating asset that needs to be subtracted is excess cash. First, we need to find each of the parts of the formula.

Part 1. Equity Value
To calculate the market value of equity, we take the price per share and multiply it by fully diluted shares outstanding. 
Step 1. Calculating Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding (FDSO). 
Step 1a: Identify the Formula Components
Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) + PSUs (Performance Shares Outstanding) + Stock Warrants Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Convertible Bonds Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method) + Stock Options Outstanding (Using Treasury Stock Method)
Step 1b: Find Common Stock Outstanding
I can see on the balance sheet that there are 442,793,000 common stock shares outstanding
Step 1c: Factor in Dilutive Securities
First I check for RSUs and PSUs. In Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation, I see there are 2,799 RSUs (in thousands) outstanding at the end of 2024. Further, reading the note, I see this count is inclusive of PSUs.
Next I check for stock warrants, I see nothing in Note 7—Stock-Based Compensation or the Statement of Equity, so I assume Costco has no stock warrants. I similarly check for stock options and see nothing.
Next I check for convertible bonds, from the Balance Sheet, I see Costco has no preferred stock shares issued or outstanding. 
Step 1d: Apply the Formula
Fully Diluted Shares = Common Stock Outstanding + RSUs + PSUs
Calculation: 442,793,000 + 2,799,000 = 445,592,000
Step 2. Finding price per share, which is given as $940 / share.
Therefore, the market value of equity = 445,592,000 * 940 = $418,856 million

Part 2. Debt / Debt Equivalents
To compute debt and debt equivalents for 2024, we need to add up all forms of debt and equivalents of debt (liabilities that have an interest expense component). We can use a formula to get started: debt = short term or current debt + long term debt + operating lease liabilities + financial lease liabilities + other debt equivalents. 

Step 1: Find Debt
From the Balance Sheet, we find the current portion of long-term debt is 103 and long-term debt, excluding current portion, is 5,794. Next, is to look for lease liabilities. 
Step 2: Find Debt-like Liabilities
From Note 5—Leases, I find total lease liabilities. of 4,052. From Note 5—Leases, I also see Costco is reporting a unique lease cost called ""Variable lease costs"". However, there is no corresponding variable lease liability in the balance sheet, which means that it is either embedded into other liabilities or not included. Looking at mentions of other current and long-term liability, I find no mention relating to variable lease liabilities, so I assume that it is not in the balance sheet and needs to be added. In order to estimate the variable lease, I need to use the given information, which is variable lease cost. One way to make a comparison is to take the ratio of operating lease costs to variable lease costs to estimate variable lease liability, where variable lease liability = operating lease liability * (variable lease costs / operating lease costs) = (179 + 2,375) * (163 / 284) = 1,465.85, where operating lease liability is the sum of current operating lease liability and long-term operating lease liability. 
Step 3: Apply Formula:
Now we have Debt = ST Debt + LT Debt + operating lease liability + financial lease liability + variable lease liability = 103 + 5,794 + 4,052 + 1,465.85 = $11,414.85 (in millions).

Step 3. Next, looking for mentions of preferred equity. Spotted preferred stock in the income statement, but there are no shares issued.

Step 4. Next, looking for mentions of minority interest or noncontrolling interest. There is a line item in the income statement, stating net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, but in 2024, that number is zero, so we can assume that there is no minority interest. There is no mention of noncontrolling interest or minority interest on the balance sheet.

Part 5. Excess cash and other non-operating assets
Excess cash can be calculated by taking cash and cash equivalents and subtracting operating cash.
Step 1. Calculating operating cash. 
Given operating cash isn't provided, we need to calculate cash and cash equivalents as well as 2% of revenue. First, assume operating cash to be 2% of 2024 Revenue, or 254,453 * 0.02 = 5089.06. 
Next, To compute cash and cash equivalents for 2024, we can start by using the formula: cash = cash + cash equivalents, like short-term marketable securities. From the balance sheet, I see a cash and cash equivalents balance of 9,906 and short-term investments balance of 1,238. From Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, I confirm that short-term investments are short-term, low-risk investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. Looking for other short term assets, like other current assets, I do not see any similarities to cash or highly liquid assets. Hence, Cash is 9,906 + 1,238 = $11,144 (in millions)
Since 5089 < 11144, or operating cash is less than cash or cash equivalents, 5089.06 is the operating cash, which is the minimum of the two numbers.
Step 2. Calculating Excess Cash
As given before, cash and cash equivalents is 11144, so excess cash is 11144 - 5089 = $6054.94 (in millions)

Putting it all together, EV = (445,592,000 * 940)/100000 + 11,414.85 - 6054.94 = $424,216 (in millions) 

Step 2: Find Sales
On the Income Statement, I see 2024 Sales was 254,453

Step 3: Apply Formula:
EV/ Sales = 424,216  / 254,453 = 1.67x",1.67x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,assumption

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",Calculate Asset Turnover for 2024.,"To calculate Asset Turnover, I will apply the formula: Asset Turnover = Sales / Average Total Assets.

Sales on the Income Statement is 254,453.

From the balance sheet, total assets was 69,831 in 2024 and 68,994 in 2023.

Hence Asset Turnover  = 254,453 / ((69,831 + 68,994)/2) = 3.67x",3.67x,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

Our members may utilize their memberships at all of our warehouses and e-commerce sites. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals;
Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license, or comparable document.
Business members may add additional cardholders (affiliates), to which the same annual fee applies. Affiliates are not available for Gold Star
members. During fiscal 2024, our annual fee for these memberships was $60 in the U.S. and varies in other countries. All paid memberships
include a free household card.
Paid members (except affiliates) were eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S., for an additional annual fee of $60. Executive
memberships are also available in Canada, Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Australia, for which the additional fee varies. Executive
members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of $1,000 per year), redeemable at Costco warehouses.
The sales penetration of Executive members represented approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.
Our member renewal rate was 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide at the end of 2024. The majority of members renew within
six months following their renewal date. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures
renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. Our membership counts include active memberships as well as
memberships that have not renewed within the 12 months prior to the reporting date.
Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Effective September 1, 2024, we increased our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliates to $65
per year. The Executive membership fee increased from $120 to $130 (membership fee of $65, plus Executive upgrade of $65), and the
maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

Company's 401(k) plan, a net non-recurring tax benefit of $63 related to a transfer pricing settlement and certain true-ups of tax reserves, and
$45 of excess tax benefits related to stock compensation. In 2023 and 2022, tax benefits of $54 and $94 were recognized related to stock
compensation.

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What was Sales per store in 2024?,"To calculate Sales per Store I will use the equation Sales per Store = Total Sales / Total # of stores.

From the Income Statement, I see total sales was 254,453 in 2024.

From Item 2—Properties, I see Costco operates 890 stores.

Hence Sales per Square Feet = $254,453 / 890 stores = $285.90 / store",$285.90,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

The components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:
The deferred tax accounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 include deferred income tax assets of $548 and $491, included in other long-term
assets; and deferred income tax liabilities of $769 and $795, included in other long-term liabilities.
In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax

(1)134 of the 187 leases are land-only leases, where Costco owns the building.
At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What was Sales per sq ft in 2024?,"To calculate Sales per Square Feet I will use the equation Sales per Square Feet = Total Sales / Average Total Square Feet.

From the Income Statement, I see total sales was 254,453 in 2024.

From Item 2—Properties, I see that costco had 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space in 2024. Ideally I'd take the average square feet over the year, however 2023 square was not provided. 

Hence Sales per Square Feet = $254,453 (in millions) / 130.9 sq ft (in millions) = $1,943.87/sq ft.","$1,943.87",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of 17,500,000 shares (10,000,000 RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the
remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate
of 27,800,000 shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs
are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was
increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $674.62 on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to
the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $662.70 on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by
approximately 52,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not
change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted,
which resulted in an additional 128,000 RSU shares available to be granted.
Summary of Restricted Stock Unit Activity
At the end of 2024, 7,278,000 shares were available to be granted as RSUs, and the following awards, adjusted for the effects of the special
dividend, were outstanding:
• 2,677,000 time-based RSUs, which vest upon continued employment or service over specified periods of time; and
• 122,000 performance-based RSUs, of which 95,000 were granted to executive officers subject to the determination of the attainment of
performance targets for 2024, which occurred in September 2024. At that time, depending upon long-service terms, at least 33% of the
units vested. The remaining awards vest upon continued employment over specified periods of time. Please refer to Note 1 for
accelerated vesting requirements.

Short-Term Borrowings
The Company maintains various short-term bank credit facilities, with a borrowing capacity of $1,198 and $1,234, in 2024 and 2023. Short-term
borrowings outstanding were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Long-Term Debt
The Company's long-term debt consists primarily of Senior Notes, described below. The Company at its option may redeem the Senior Notes at
any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price plus accrued interest. The redemption price is equal to the greater of 100% of the principal
amount or the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to maturity. Additionally, upon certain
events, a holder has the right to require a repurchase at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest on all
outstanding long-term debt is payable semi-annually. The estimated fair value of Senior Notes is valued using Level 2 inputs.
Other long-term debt consists of Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by the Company's Japanese subsidiary, valued using Level 3 inputs. In
November 2023, the Company’s Japan subsidiary issued four Guaranteed Senior Notes, totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates
ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%. Interest is payable semi-annually, and maturity dates range from November 7, 2033, to November 7, 2043. In
July 2024, the Japanese subsidiary repaid $77 of its Guaranteed Senior Notes.
On May 18, 2024, the Company paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance and interest on the 2.750% Senior Notes using cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments.
At the end of 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $5,412 and
$5,738. The carrying value of long-term debt consisted of the following:
2.750% Senior Notes due May 2024 3.000% Senior Notes due May 2027 1.375% Senior Notes due June 2027 1.600% Senior Notes due April 2030 1.750% Senior Notes due April 2032 Other long-term debt Total long-term debt Less current portion (1)

maximum annual 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership increased from $1,000 to $1,250.Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization. The Company
reviews goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or when circumstances indicate carrying value may exceed the fair value. This
evaluation is performed at the reporting unit level. If a qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less
than carrying value, a quantitative analysis is completed using either the income or market approach, or a combination of both. The income
approach estimates fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows, while the market approach uses comparable public companies
and transactions to develop metrics to be applied to historical and expected future operating results.
Goodwill is included in other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes goodwill by reportable
segment:

In 2024 and 2023, the Company had valuation allowances of $494 and $422, primarily related to foreign tax credits that the Company believes
will not be realized due to carry forward limitations. The foreign tax credit carryforwards are set to expire beginning in fiscal 2030.
The Company generally no longer considers fiscal year earnings of non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries (other than China) indefinitely reinvested
after 2023, in the case of Taiwan, and after 2017, in the case of all other subsidiaries, and has recorded the estimated incremental foreign
withholding taxes (net of available foreign tax credits) and state income taxes payable assuming a hypothetical repatriation to the U.S. The
Company considers undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. consolidated subsidiaries, which totaled $3,135, to be indefinitely reinvested and
has not provided for withholding or state taxes.

Table of Contents
The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the
timing of such deductibility. At the end of 2024 and 2023, these amounts were immaterial. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of these tax positions would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the
payment of cash to the taxing authority. The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective
income tax rate in future periods is $79 and $14 at the end of 2024 and 2023.
Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are classified as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and
penalties recognized during 2024 and 2023, and accrued at the end of each respective period were immaterial.
The Company is currently under audit by several jurisdictions in the United States and abroad. Some audits may conclude in the next 12
months, and the unrecognized tax benefits recorded in relation to the audits may differ from actual settlement amounts. It is not practical to
estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection
with the audits. The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits in the next 12 months.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, in Canada, and in several other foreign
jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examination for years before fiscal 2018. The
Company is currently subject to examination in California for fiscal years 2013 to present.
Other Taxes
The Company is subject to multiple examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll, product, import or other non-income taxes in various
jurisdictions. In certain cases, the Company has received assessments from the authorities. Possible losses or range of possible losses
associated with these matters are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss cannot be made at this time. If certain
matters or a group of matters were to be decided adversely to the Company, it could result in a charge that might be material to the results of an
individual fiscal quarter or year.Item 2—Properties

At the end of 2024, our warehouses contained approximately 130.9 million square feet of operating floor space: 91.1 million in the U.S.; 15.5 million in Canada; and 24.3 million in Other International. Total square feet associated with distribution and logistics facilities were approximately 31.9 million. Additionally, we operate various processing, packaging, manufacturing and other facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.Note 11—Segment Reporting
The Company is principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses through wholly owned subsidiaries in the U.S., Canada,
Mexico, Japan, the U.K., Korea, Australia, Taiwan, China, Spain, France, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Reportable segments are largely
based on management’s organization of the operating segments for operational decisions and assessments of financial performance, which
considers geographic locations. The material accounting policies of the segments are as described in Note 1. Inter-segment net sales and
expenses have been eliminated in computing total revenue and operating income.

(1) Comparable sales for 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $11,915 or 5% during 2024. The improvement was attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at new
warehouses opened in 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Sales increased $10,639, or 6% in core
merchandise categories, increasing in all categories. Sales increased $1,276, or 3% in warehouse ancillary and other businesses, led by
pharmacy, partially offset by a decrease in gasoline.
During 2024, the volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively impacting net sales by $400, or 17 basis points, which includes
the impact of one less week of sales in 2024. Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $917, or 39 basis points, compared to
2023, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales
by approximately $474, 20 basis points, compared to 2023, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.
Comparable Sales
Comparable sales increased 5% during 2024 and were positively impacted by an increase in shopping frequency, partially offset by a slight
decrease in average ticket.",What was Sales per sq ft cut by geography in 2024?,"To calculate Sales per Square Feet by Geo I will use the equation Sales per Square Feet = Total Sales / Average Total Square Feet for each geography.

From Note 11—Segment Reporting, I see 2024 total revenue was 184,143 in the US, 34,874 in Canada, and 35,436 in Other International.

From Item 2—Properties, I see that square feet per geography was 91.1 million in the U.S., 15.5 million in Canada, and 24.3 million in Other International. 

Hence Sales per Square Feet was (184,143 /  91.1) = $2,021.33 in the US, (34,874 / 15.5) = $2,249.94 in Canada, and (35,436 / 24.3) = $1,458.27 in Other International.","US: $2,021.33; Canada: $2,249.94 International: $1,458.27",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm,COST_10K_2024,Costco,basic
,"Company X trades at $15 per share and has 80 shares outstanding, with $80 in net income. Company Y trades at $30 per share, has 15 shares outstanding, and earns $20 in net income. Company X acquires Company Y at no premium, paying 60% in new stock and 40% in cash. After the transaction, what is the percentage change in Company X's EPS?",Company X must issue (($30 * 15) * 60%) / $15 = 18 new shares. Total shares for Company X become 80+18 = 98. New EPS is ($80+$20)/(80+18) = 1.02. Original EPS was $80/80 = 1.00 so EPS increases by 2%.,2%,,,,conceptual

However, investing in Company X requires 4 turns of leverage while investing in Company Y requires 7 turns.

However, investing in Company X requires 4 turns of leverage while investing in Company Y requires 7 turns. Which investment has a higher unlevered IRR?","Levered IRR is based on Levered Cash Flow = Unlevered Cash Flow - Debt Service, while unlevered IRR is based on Unlevered Cash Flow. If both deals have the same levered IRR, investment in company X would yield a higher Unlevered Cash Flow and unlevered IRR since there is less debt to service. ",Company X,,,,conceptual
,"Suppose Company X trades at $10 per share, with a P/E ratio of 2x, and it has 300 shares outstanding. Company Y trades at $8 per share, with a P/E ratio of 2x, and has 120 shares outstanding. Company X plans to buy Company Y for $9 per share, funding half of the purchase with cash (raised through debt at a 6% cost of debt that matures over four years) and half with newly issued stock. The deal also incurs $15 in financing costs and $20 in transaction fees. Is this acquisition accretive or dilutive to Company X?","Company X's net income = EPS (which is price per share / P/E) * total shares = ($10 / 2) * 300 = $1,500. 
Company Y's net income is ($8 / 2x) * 120 = 480.
Total purchase price of Company Y is $9 * 120 = $1,080. Half ($540) is cash and half is new stock.
$540 in cash is funded by 6% cost of debt, creating annual interest of $540 * 0.06 = $32.4
The stock half requires issuing $540 / $10 = 54 new shares, increasing Company X's share count to 354.
Pro-forma net income is $1,500 + $480 - $32.4 = $1,947.6 and pro-forma EPS is $1,947.6 / 354 = $5.50, which is higher than the original $10 / 2 = $5, so the deal is accretive.",Accretive,,,,conceptual
,"Suppose a company issues 100 million in debt and uses the proceeds to repurchase its own shares. What is the effect on the company's Enterprise Value (increase, decrease, or no change)?","When the debt is raised, debt increases and cash increases. The cash is used to repurchase shares, reducing cash and 100m of equity value. In total, debt is up 100m, cash is unchanged, and equity value is down 100m. Hence EV changes by +100m + 0m + (-100m) = 0. Hence EV is unchanged.",No change,,,,conceptual
,"Suppose a company raises 25 million of debt and uses it to buy back shares from its shareholders. How does this transaction affect the firm's equity value (increase, decrease, or no change)?","When the debt is raised, cash increases by 25m. Then the 25m is used to purchase equity, reducing equity value by 25m. Equity value is unchanged by cash so equity value decreases by $25m. ",Decrease,,,,conceptual
,"Consider a firm with a market cap of 800 million and net income of 80 million that takes on 100 million in debt to buy back shares. How does this transaction influence its P/E multiple (increase, decrease or no change)?","Shares outstanding decreases, causing EPS (net income / shares outstanding) to increase. Hence P/E decreases, assuming price per share stays constant.",Decrease,,,,conceptual
,"A firm generating 50 of EBITDA at a 20% EBITDA margin is bought at a 10x multiple, using 40% debt to finance the deal. If the company has 100 of cash at exit and is sold at a 10x multiple after five years, what annual revenue growth rate is needed to receive a 25% IRR?","Initial revenue is 50 / 20% = 100.
The entry EV is 50 * 10x = 500 financed with 500 * 40% = 200 of debt and 300 of equity.
Over a 5 year hold, the equity must triple to reach a 25% IRR, which would be 300 * 3 900. 
Subtracting 100 of exit cash and adding 200 of debt, implies an exit EV of 1000.
At a 10x multiple, final year EBITDA must be 1000 / 10 = 100.

,"Suppose you buy a $75 Starbucks gift card, then spend the entire balance on drinks. What happens to Starbucks's cash flow at the moment you use that $75 (cash inflow, cash outflow, or no change)?","Starbucks initially records an unearned revenue liability when the gift card was purchased. This corresponds to a cash inflow. However, when the gift card is spent there is no new cash received by Starbucks (the unearned revenue turns to revenue) so cash is unchanged.",No change,,,,conceptual

To purchase Y, ≈ issues $1,500 / 40 = 37.5 new shares. The combined net income is 200 + 50 = 250, and the total share count is 100 + 37.5 = 137.5.

,"The firm currently has 200 of PIK debt at an 10% interest rate and faces a 35% tax rate, how will this flow through the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement?","On the income statement, pre-tax income is down by 20 (200 * 10%). With a 35% tax rate, net income is down by 20 * (0.65) = 13. On the cash flow statement, net income is down by 13. However, since PIK is a non-cash expense it is added back, so cash is up by 7, which is -13 + 20. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 7. On the liabilities side, debt is up by 20, from the interest accruing to the principal. Retained earnings is down by 13, so liabilities + equity is up by 7 (20 - 13), balancing with assets.","On the income statement, pre-tax income is down by 20 (200 * 10%).

,"A firm borrowed $300 in order to buy goods. It later sold those goods for $600, incurred $150 in operating expenses, paid 6% interest on the loan, and repaid 12% of the original principal. Assume a tax rate of 10% How are the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement affected after this transaction?","In the income statement, revenue is up 600, subtract 300 for COGS, 150 for Opex, so EBIT is 600 -300 -150 = 150. Interest expense is 300 * .12 = 36. Pre-tax income is 150 - 36 = 114. Post-tax income is 114 * 0.9 or 102.6. On the cash flow statement net income is up 102.6 and you add back 300 since inventory went down (and was a non-cash expense), 12% of principal is paid back or .12 * 300 = 36, so cash is up by 102.6 + 300 - 36 = 366.6. On the balance sheet, cash is up by 366.6, inventory is down by 300. On the liabilities side, debt is down by 36 and retained earnings is up by 102.6. 366.6 - 300 = 66.6.

,Company X buys back stock with debt. How does that impact the P/E ratio of the company?,"The PE ratio is Price over Earnings. The denominator will decrease by new interest expense from the debt, but there is a tax shield on that interest. The numerator decreases as well since share count decreases. If we call the previous PE ratio, P / E, the new PE ratio is (P - debt) / (E - debt * interest rate * (1 - tax rate)). Since the post tax cost of debt is usually less than the inverse P/E ratio, the P/E ratio usually decreases.",P/E ratio typically decreases,,,,conceptual
